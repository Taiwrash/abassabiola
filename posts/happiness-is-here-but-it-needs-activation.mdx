Have you ever been confronted with the question…?
Where – and How Much – is Happiness?
*When asked, on Tuesday 25th May 2021 at the Extroverted Introvert Webinar, ‘what is your future ambition? This writer answered, “My future ambition – and everyday ambition – is to be happy”.*
Just because happiness is not like commodities we trade in shopping malls or in retail stores, a lot of people have fallen into the error of thinking that *‘happiness is free’.*
But wait…are you one of them?
I hope you’re not.
## Is happiness really free?
Sometimes, I think nothing in this life is free. And nothing should ever be taken for granted. Even the ‘free oxygen’ turns out to be a very expensive commodity whenever it becomes a commodity. Peace becomes expensive, when crises strike – Ukrainians and the Ukraine government can now relate better ‘how much is the cost of peace?’.
Happiness too, just like some other seemingly free commodities of life, is not free. Well, how must does it cost? Where do we refill whenever we’re running low on happiness? I’ll soon get to that in the paragraphs that follow.
## Is this a quest for pseudo-happiness or what?
Don’t you wonder why some writers and motivational speakers often tell you happiness is free?
Do you also think about it?
Well, I do…and I’ve realized that there’s a free version of happiness.
I think it’s *‘pseudo-happiness’*. That is, happiness that is not happiness. Sad happiness. Fake happiness. Or simply happiness that is not ‘sustainable’.
Real happiness – that happiness that is really happiness – requires effort. “Happiness is a choice that requires effort at times”, said Aeschyluhs.
Hey: Aeschylus is pronounced [ee-skuh-luhs]
## Where then is TRUE happiness?
Well, let’s give them a justification. Those that claim ‘happiness is free’ say so because we don’t buy happiness with money or any form of tangible asset. But what they don’t realize is that happiness is elusive. It is the rarest and most expensive commodity in the world – this is because everyone wants it.
If happiness is truly this expensive and we can’t buy it with money or get it in retail stores…where then is true happiness?
Simply, happiness resides there in the mind. That’s a way of saying the happiness I need to live my life is already in my mind. So it is for you. All we need is just a little effort.
Think of happiness as a WhatsApp mobile app. You have made the first effort of buying the android device that supports WhatsApp, right. You went ahead to buy your sim cards. Then, the data bundle. And, straight you go, to the play store. You acquired your copy of the WhatsApp. And, back you go, to your phone.
You know, at this point, everything you desire – the app, the data bundle, the app itself – are already on the phone and right there in your hand.
I’m sure you already know where I’m driving to…
To enjoy the app, you’ve used all this effort on, you need to do one last thing…
It is called…ACTIVATION!
Such is the similitude of the happiness we’re talking about.
The happiness is already within, just like the whatsapp you downloaded from google play store. However, to enjoy it, effort is required from you. Plus, some enormous sacrifice.

## Okay, what’s your UHAC – Unique Happiness Activation Code?
Well, I have my UHAC already. I’ll soon gist you about it towards the end of this conversation.
But before that, let’s just look at some general efforts and sacrifices that are necessary to get your happiness activated.
To be happy generally, you need to sacrifice these:
+ Your ego and entitlement mentality
+ Your precious and priceless time
+ Your stance and justifications
+ Your busy schedule (to chase your own happiness) etc.

You read that correctly, ‘to be happy generally…’
But it’s not enough to be happy generally, *you want to be happy and remain happy.*
I got my unique activation code on…my bad, I forgot to write the date in my journal. Well, I’m sure it was in a ‘journaling session’, thinking about something that was making me really feel sad (please don’t ask me what it is, I can’t reveal this).
Towards the end of my journaling, I came across my major sources of happiness. I found my UHAC – Unique Happiness activation code (don’t worry to ask, I’ll disclose this just the way it was written in my journal):
*   I derive pleasure in helping others; I must start working deliberately on helping MORE people.
*   I see joy in making money; I should try to focus more on my money-making drive (I feel shy to include this, but I’ve promised to disclose this just as it was written in my journal).
*   I derive great sense of fulfilment from learning, exploring and impacting with my knowledge; I must work more on it.
What next…?
Find your UHAC. Go and journal. Go ahead and reflect on your life. Go and meditate!

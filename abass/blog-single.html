                  Where – and How Much – is Happiness? When asked, on Tuesday 25th May 2021 at the Extroverted Introvert Webinar, ‘what is your future ambition? This writer answered, “My future ambition and everyday ambition is to be happy”. Just because happiness is not like commodities we trade in shopping malls or in retail stores, a lot of people have fallen into the error of thinking that ‘happiness is free’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But wait…are you one of them? I hope you’re not. Is happiness really free? Sometimes, I think nothing in this life is free. And nothing should be taken for granted. Even the ‘free oxygen’ turns out to be a very expensive commodity whenever it becomes a commodity. Peace becomes expensive, when crises strike – Ukrainians and the Ukraine government can now relate better ‘how much is the cost of peace?’. Happiness too, just like some other seemingly free commodities of life, is not free. Well, how must does it cost? Where do we refill whenever we’re running low on happiness? I’ll soon get to that in the paragraphs that follow. Is this a quest for pseudo-happiness or what? Don’t you wonder why some writers and motivational speakers often tell youthat happiness is free?

                  Do you also think about it? Well, I do…and I’ve realized that there’s a free version of happiness.I think it’s pseudo-happiness. That is, happiness that is not happiness. Fake happiness or happiness that is not sustainable. Real happiness – that happiness that is really happiness requires effort. “Happiness is a choice that requires effort at times”, said Aeschyluhs. Hey: Aeschylus is pronounced [ee-skuh-luhs] Where then is TRUE happiness? Well, let’s give them a justification. Those that claim that ‘happiness is free’ say so because we don’t buy happiness with money. But what they don’trealize is that happiness is the rarest and most expensive commodity in theworld – this is because everyone wants it. If happiness is truly this expensive and we can’t buy it with money or get it inretail store, where then is true happiness? Simply, happiness resides there in the mind. That’s a way of saying the happiness I need to live my life is already in my mind. So it is for you. All we need is just a little effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Think of happiness as a whatsapp mobile app. You have made the first effort of buying the android device that supports whatsapp, right. You went ahead
                  to buy your sim cards. Then, the data bundle. And, straight you go, to the play
                  store. You acquired your copy of the whatsapp. And, back you go, to your
                  phone.
                  You know, at this point, everything you desire – the app, the data bundle, the
                  app itself – are already on the phone and right there in your hand.
                  I’m sure you already know where I’m driving to…
                  To enjoy the app you’ve used all this efforts on, you need to do one last
                  thing…
                  It is called…ACTIVATION!
                  Such is the similitude of the happiness we’re talking about.
                  The happiness is already within, just like the whatsapp you downloaded from
                  google play store. However, to enjoy it, effort is required from you. Plus some
                  enormous sacrifice.

                  <p class="mb-0">Okay, what’s your UHAC – Unique Happiness Activation Code?</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Well, I have my unique UHAC already. I’ll soon gist you about it towards the
                  end of this conversation.
                  But before that, let’s just look at some general efforts and sacrifices that are
                  necessary to get your happiness activated.
                  To be happy generally, you need to sacrifice these:
                   Your ego and entitlement mentality
                   Your precious and priceless time
                   Your stance and justifications
                   Your busy schedule (to chase your own happiness) etc.
                  You read that correctly, ‘to be happy generally…’
                  But it’s not enough to be happy generally, you want to be happy and remain
                  happy.
                  I got my unique activation code on…my bad, I forgot to write the date in my
                  journal. Well, I’m sure it was in a journaling session about something that was
                  making me really feel sad (please don’t ask me what it is, I can’t reveal this).
                  Towards the end of my journal, I came across my major sources of happiness.
                  I found my UHAC – Unique Happiness activation code (don’t worry to ask, I’ll
                  disclose this just the way it was written in my journal):
                   I derive pleasure in helping others; I must start working deliberately on
                  helping MORE people.
                   I see joy in making money; I should try to focus more on my moneymaking drive (I feel shy to include this, but I’ve promised to disclose this
                  just as it was written in my journal).
                   I derive great sense of fulfilment from learning, exploring and
                  impacting with my knowledge; I must work more on it.
                  What next…?
                  Find your UHAC.
                  Confused on how to?
                  You can reach out to me here, if you think we can talk about it.
                  Likewise, you can talk to any of your mentors who can help you. You’re special, you know?
                  I’m deeply rooting for you.
                  I’m your friend who want to D.I.E. More for you.
                  Bye for now.
